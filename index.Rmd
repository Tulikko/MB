For the reader: You can click the black "code" box on the right hand side to either see or hide the R code behind analysis results and graphs. 

The results are arranged to separate tabs by site/area, so that it's easy to look at just the results of the site of interest, instead of scrolling accidentally down to a different site and getting confused.

The results for each site consist of four parts: pXRF, particle size distribution, loss on ignition, and colorimetry.
